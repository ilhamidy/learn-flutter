# 🚀 Flutter Learning Project – 30 Days Challenge

This repository contains documentation and collections of Flutter projects that I build during my **30-Day Flutter Learning Challenge**.  
Each day includes different topics, experiments, and mini-projects to strengthen my skills in:

- Flutter Layouting (Row, Column, Stack, Container, etc.)
- Basic Navigation & State Management
- Core & Advanced Widgets
- UI/UX Component Building
- Forms, TextField, and Validation
- Local Storage
- Firebase (optional)
- Mini App Development

---

## 📁 Folder Structure
Each day is organized into a separate folder:

day-1    [✅]


> 📌 Note: The folder structure is created manually. Each folder contains its own project, notes, or experiments.

---

## 🔧 How to Run a Project
Make sure Flutter is installed:
```bash
flutter --version
cd day05
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

🌟 Goal of This Challenge
Learn and master Flutter fundamentals in 30 days
Build a complete mini application (multi-page, forms, state, modern UI)
Create a consistent daily coding routine
